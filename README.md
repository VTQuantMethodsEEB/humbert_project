  Northern Flying Squirrel habitat model data
  
  This data was collected in 2017 in a study to determine the physical variables to make a Virginia Northern Flying Squirrel’s habitat. This was done by setting out nesting boxes in various locations, putting telemetry collars on squirrels, and overlaying random points across the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia. Al all these points landform and forest structure variables were collected and then used to tease out the variables the squirrels were choosing for by comparing the structure of from of the squirrel plots to the random plots. As the data set is now, all the non-selected variables have been removed, and what remains is the making of the model. The remains are the making of the model. My advisors wish to overlay a canopy model from other data sources onto this model as well as compare how our model predicts squirrel selection when applied to ancillary data sources (NLCD, land fire, TNC, and the MNF database). I would like to use this data to add canopy heights to the habitat model and explore comparing snag densities between random and squirrel points.  It would be nice to do this in throughout the class but if I learn R I will have gotten my money’s worth.
  
##WEEK 1##
CODE: ex1_intro_to_R_Humbert.R
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This week we set up git and explored my data.


##WEEK 2##
CODE: le2_data_manipulation_Humbert.R 
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This Week I manipulated my data following along with the lecture script.

##WEEk 3##
CODE: week3_tannerhumbert.R
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This week I played with ggplot2 and set box plots up to look at some relationships in my data.

##WEEK 4##

No homework this week we spent time learning sataistical philosophy and working on our graphs

##WEEK 5##
CODE: loop_week6.R
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This week and into week 6 we working on testing our hypothosises by making a for loop and doing t-test.

##WEEK 6##
CODE: loop_week6.R
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This week i finished making my for loop test and ran many logistic regressions.

##WEEK 7##
CODE: week_7&8_hw.R
DATA: vnfs_treemap.csv

This week I ran a linear model of the comparison between Basal area and elevation. We found that there is a positive linear correlation between basal area and elevation and this test fit all the assumptions. 

##WEEK 8##
